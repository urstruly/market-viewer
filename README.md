# Simple implementation of Deribit Market Viewer!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)\
and built in React with TypeScript using [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting.

Unfortunately, as I am currently occupied with a big move, I couldn't spend more time to make this my best work (Please refer to [Things to do](https://github.com/urstruly/market-viewer/edit/main/README.md#things-to-do) for things I would have done differently or added to this implementation)

Also, this is my first time using websockets for real-time data, so I may not have optimized it for the best performance, but I did try to account for different use cases, for an app that displays real-time data :)

Tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari on iOS, but could not test it on browsers on Windows and Linux since I don't have a VM setup with different images on my current laptop (as I sold off my previous desktop/mac setup for the move :( )

## Steps to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Things to do

This should be prefaced by saying that I didn't have much time to spend on the app as I am in the middle of a big move (to Dubai from Europe). But here are some of the things I would've liked to have added, but couldn't in the interest of time :)

* Tests (Unit, Functional and Snapshot) :(
* Sorting for the grid
* Validation for filters on Save
* Error handling
* Favorites and Trade button links to Deribit pages
